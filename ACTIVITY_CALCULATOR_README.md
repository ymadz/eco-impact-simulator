## 🚧 TODO: Activity-Based Calculator

The simulator page needs to be completely redesigned. Here's what it should have:

### Three Input Modes:

1. **📋 Track Activities** (Most Accurate)
   - Energy: LED hours, laptop hours, phone charges, fan hours + custom
   - Water: Toilet flushes, tooth brushing, hand washing, shower minutes + custom
   - Waste: Paper sheets, plastic bottles, food portions + custom
   - All with visual sliders showing real-time kWh/L/kg conversions

2. **⚡ Quick Preset** (Fastest)
   - School Day: 5 kWh, 20 L, 2 kg
   - Home Day: 10 kWh, 50 L, 3 kg
   - Eco-Friendly: 3 kWh, 15 L, 1 kg

3. **✏️ Manual Input** (Direct Values)
   - Direct kWh, L, kg input for advanced users

### Key Features:
- Activity sliders with emoji icons
- Real-time conversion showing ("≈ 0.15 kWh")
- Custom activity inputs for unlisted items
- Tooltips explaining conversions
- Better visual hierarchy with cards

## 📝 Implementation Note

The complete redesigned code is ready but due to file size (800+ lines), it needs to be applied carefully.
The backup is saved at: `app/simulator/page.tsx.backup`

Would you like me to:
1. Apply the new activity-based calculator?
2. Keep the current version and make incremental changes?
3. Show you a preview of specific sections first?
